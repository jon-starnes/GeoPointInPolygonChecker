## Check Point in Polygon or MultiPolygon

### The isPointInsidePolygon function checks if a given point is inside a polygon. It uses the ray-casting algorithm to determine the position of the point relative to the polygon. Here's how you can use it:

const point = [5, 5];
const polygon = [[0, 0], [10, 0], [10, 10], [0, 10]];
const result = isPointInsidePolygon(point, polygon);
console.log(result); // true or false

### Raycasting Logic in checkPointInPolygon
The checkPointInPolygon function uses the ray-casting algorithm to determine if a point is inside a polygon. The algorithm works by drawing a horizontal line to the right of each point and counting how many times the line intersects with the polygon's edges. If the number of intersections is odd, the point is inside the polygon; if even, the point is outside.

### parsePolygon Function
The parsePolygon function parses a polygon from a given input. It typically converts the input data into a format that can be used for further geospatial computations.

Usage:

### parseMultiPolygon Function
The parseMultiPolygon function parses a multi-polygon from a given input. It converts the input data into a format that can be used for geospatial computations involving multiple polygons.

Usage:

These functions are essential for handling geospatial data and performing operations like point-in-polygon checks and parsing polygon data for further analysis.
